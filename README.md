👋 Hi, I’m @sirgaladad

👀 I’m interested in the intersection of design and technology, particularly in the realms of UX/UI design, web development, and mobile app creation. I'm passionate about creating seamless, intuitive digital experiences that enhance user engagement.

🌱 I’m currently learning React Native to broaden my ability to develop cross-platform mobile applications, and I'm deepening my knowledge of user-centric design principles to better align technical functionality with user needs.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects focused on adopting various Ai technologies or any initiative aiming to improve process ans automation with the use of digital products. I'm especially interested in projects that leverage AR/VR to create immersive learning experiences.
