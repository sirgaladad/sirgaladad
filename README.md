👋 Hi, I'm @sirgaladad

🎮 I'm interested in the intersection of design and technology, particularly in the realms of UX/UI design, web development, and mobile app creation. I'm passionate about creating seamless, intuitive digital experiences that enhance user engagement.

🌱 I'm now independently developing my own projects, using AI agents to assist my workflow. I'm focused on exploring a variety of programming languages across front-end, back-end, and everything in between to continuously expand my technical versatility.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects focused on adopting various AI technologies or any initiative aiming to improve process and automation with digital products. I'm especially interested in projects that leverage AR/VR to create immersive learning experiences.

📧 How to reach me: You can shoot me an email at coreyboelkens@cobobots.com or follow me on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/in/sirgaladad.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I developed an app that enabled people to order food and get it delivered by boat and the customer could track it, Summer 2016
